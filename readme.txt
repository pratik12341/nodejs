Treated with iodine, a warm aqueous solution yields iodobenzene, acetic
acid, and mercuric iodide. Aqueous or alcoholic hydrogen sulphide gives
a heavy white precipitate, which turns gray and then black, the resulting
solution containing benzene, acetic acid, and mercuric sulphide.
Heated with yellow ammonium sulphide at 100° to 310° C. in sealed
tubes gives a similar result to the preceding. Heating with arsenic
trichloride for four to five hours at 100° C, gives phenyldichloroarsine.1
Reduction by alkaline sodium stannite gives mercury diphenyl in
95-6 per cent, yield.2
Phenylmercurie propionate, prepared in the same way as the
formate, forms matted crystals, sintering at 145° C. and melting at 165°
to 166° C. It may be recrystallised from water, and is also soluble in
alcohol or benzene.
Phenylmercuric myristate. 3
 — Equal numbers of molecules of
myristic acid and mercury diphenyl are heated together in alcoholic
solution in a sealed tube at 120° C. Small, fatty, rhombic scales are obtained,
insoluble in water, soluble in boiling alcohol or benzene, and
when boiled with hydrochloric acid they are decomposed into benzene,
myristic acid, and mercuric chloride.
Phenylmercuric sulphide.4—Phenylmercuric acetate is dissolved
in ammonium hydroxide—ammonium acetate solution, and treated with
hydrogen sulphide or an alkali sulphide, when phenylmercuric sulphide
is precipitated as a white amorphous powder. It is insoluble in water
or alcohol but dissolves in chloroform, this solution soon decomposing.
Hydrochloric acid liberates hydrogen sulphide, and continued boiling
with alcohol gives mercuric sulphide and mercury diphenyl. Heated t
to 108° C. the compound blackens and decomposes.
Phenylmercuric thiocarbonate, (C6H5Hg)2CS3.—When the above
sulphide is dissolved in cold carbon bisulphide the solution first deposits
silky needles, and afterwards a yellow product which is only slightly
soluble in carbon bisulphide. This substance is the thiocarbonate,
which is insoluble in water or alcohol, slightly soluble in ether or benzene,
more soluble in chloroform, and forms a clear solution in hot fuming
hydrochloric acid. At 108° C. it blackens, mercuric sulphide being
deposited and carbon disulphide evolved. It is rapidly decomposed
when heated with benzene, with the production of mercury diphenyl and
mercuric sulphide.
Phenylmercuric thiosulphate.5—Two molecules of phenylmercuric
acetate in ammonium hydroxide—ammonium acetate solution are
treated with one molecule of sodium thiosulphate. when a white precipitate
is obtained, insoluble in ordinary solvents but dissolving in
concentrated hydrochloric acid, with evolution of sulphur dioxide and
deposition of sulphur. This thiosulphate readily dissolves in aqueous
sodium thiosulphate, the solution giving mercury diphenyl on standing.
The compound is not decomposed when heated to 200° C.
Compounds of Di(phenylmercuri)-amine, (C6H5Hg)2NH.6
Pesci has shown that phenylmercuric salts react with ammonia to
form salts of (CeHfiHg)2NH—, these compounds yielding ammonia

The sulphate is precipitated by sodium sulphate and is an infusible
precipitate, forming a compound with ammonium sulphate,
[(C6H5Hg)2NH2]2S04.(NH4)2S04
which crystallises in rectangular tablets.
The chloride, prepared from phenylmercuric chloride, crystallises in
microscopic prisms, melting at 184° C. with decomposition.
Tetr a (phenylmercuri) thiourea, (CeHBHg)4NaCS.—The above
acetate treated with thiourea gives this derivative and ammonium
acetate. It is insoluble in the usual solvents and darkens at 104° to
105° C. . When boiled with alcohol it decomposes, giving mercuric
sulphide, mercury diphenyl, and phenylmercuri cyanamide,
(C6H5Hg),N2CS-HgS + (C6H5)2Hg + (C6H5Hg)3N-CN
Phenylmercuri cyanamide, formed as shown above, is a white
amorphous powder which decomposes when heated. It is decomposed
by cold dilute hydrochloric acid into phenylmercuric chloride and
cyanamide.
Tolylmercuric Compounds.
o-Tolylmercurie chloride may be prepared by treating o-toiyl
boric acid with mercuric chloride,1
 or by separating it from the para
compound formed when toluene is mercurated by mercuric acetate after
treating the mixture with sodium chloride.2
 It crystallises from
alcohol in white crystals, M.pt. 146° C.3
o-Tolylmercuric bromide.4—To a solution of 28 grams of o-tolyl
magnesium bromide in 100 grams of ether, 58 grams of mercuric bromide
arc added, the mixture shaken for one hour, boiled for two hours, and
then allowed to stand over-night. It is then worked up in the usual way,
when 42 grains (78 per cent, yield) of the bromide are obtained. From
xylene or alcohol it forms hair-fine needles, M.pt, 168° C, easily soluble
in pyridine or aniline and reprecipitated by the addition of petroleum
ether. It is only slightly soluble in cold alcohol, ether, benzene, chloroform,
or acetone, but readily soluble in hot benzene or its homologues.
The crystals are not affected by light;
o-Tolylmercuric iodide.—When the above bromide is boiled with
alcoholic potassium iodide in slight excess, a quantitative yield of the

iodide is obtained. It crystallises in prisms from alcohol, melting at
176° to 177-5° C, and has a similar solubility to the bromide.
o-Tolylmercuri c sulphide.—When hydrogen sulphide is passed
into a pyridine-ether solution of the above iodide at —10° C, the pale
yellow sulphide is precipitated. In the presence of moisture it soon
decomposes and blackens, mercuric sulphide separating out.
